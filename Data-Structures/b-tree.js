B-trees are a type of self-balancing search tree, which are optimal for systems with large amounts of data and are widely used in databases and filesystems. 
The key advantage of B-trees is their ability to maintain balance, meaning the tree depth remains relatively small even as the tree grows in size. 
This keeps the amount of time it takes to traverse the tree (time complexity) at a logarithmic scale.

Here's a very high-level overview of what a B-tree might look like:

1. A B-tree of order m is a tree which satisfies the following properties:
    Every node has at most m children.
    Every node (except root and leaves) has at least m/2 children.
    The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node.
    All leaves appear in the same level, and carry no information.
2. Each internal nodeâ€™s keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees.

class BTreeNode {
    constructor(order) {
        this.order = order;
        this.values = []; // Stores the keys
        this.child = []; // Stores the child pointers
        this.leaf = true; // True when node is a leaf. All leaves are at same level
    }

    // ...insert, search, split methods
    // ...delete, merge methods
}

/*

This class has properties for the order of the B-tree, the keys of the node, the child pointers, 
and a boolean to identify if the node is a leaf or not. To have a working B-tree, 
you would need to implement various methods to handle operations like insert, delete, split and merge according to B-tree properties.
