/*
A Red-Black Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree where each node has an extra bit for denoting the color of the node, either red or black. 
A Red-Black Tree is a balanced binary tree that guarantees searching in O(log n) time. Here are the important properties of a Red-Black Tree:

1. Each node is either red or black.
2. The root is black. This rule is sometimes omitted.
3. All leaves (null) are black.
4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5. Every path from a given node to any of its descendant null nodes contains the same number of black nodes.

Note that insertion and deletion in Red-Black Tree are more complex due to the coloring and re-coloring of nodes, along with the standard BST operations.

class Node {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data; 
        this.color = "red"; 
        this.left = null; 
        this.right = null; 
        this.parent = null;
    }
}

class RedBlackTree {
    constructor() {
        this.nullLeaf = new Node(null);
        this.nullLeaf.color = "black";
        this.root = this.nullLeaf;
    }

    // ... insert, delete, search methods
    // ... leftRotate, rightRotate methods
    // ... reBalanceTree method
    // ... reColor method
}

/*
Note that this is not a complete or functional Red-Black tree implementation. 
A full Red-Black tree would have detailed methods for insertion, deletion, balancing, and re-coloring, which are non-trivial to implement.

If you are looking to work with Red-Black Trees in JavaScript, it's probably best to look for an existing library that has already implemented these, 
or be prepared for a substantial project to implement it yourself.
